The service is named AerodromeMapInformation service, abbreviated to AMIS and was modelled with two service interfaces each with several operations. The two service interfaces are: \u2022 AccessAMDBFeatures: This interface provides the user with the requested features from the AMDB (Airport Map Database). The features capable of being requested is a subset of the total set of feature types available from the AFIS (ATM Feature Information Service).. \u2022 AccessAMDBMap: Returns to the user the map of the airport in a graphical form with the features rendered according to a pre-set set of styles. The content consists of 40 FeatureTypes covering geospatial information of an airport layout. An AMDB or parts of it is primarily intended to be used as map layers. Actual Implementation The Avitech SWIM product provides a service which covers the first half of the envisioned functionalities for this service, i.e. the storage, query and management of Airport Features over a standardized interface. In this case WFS-T v2.0, providing Airport Mapping data either in AMXM or in AIXM 5.1 format. Notification about changes is possible through a publish/subscribe mechanism, based on REST and XPath. Source: Commercial for demo purposes and RTCA/EUROCAE official sample data from old or new releases Coverage: FANS Group - CYYC, KDCA, KIAH, LETO, LGRP, LROP, LFMN, MMMX, MMTO, MROC, OMAD, VABB, VIDP, UKKK, URSS, YBAS (all 16 available but only 8 of these will be made available for the demo, the choice depends on the scenario), if RTCA sample data is made available then most probably 1 or 2 airports more will be available Type of Data: \"older\" data (FANS Group offers also updated versions for purchase), data available with standard (RTCA)"

The service is part of our SWIM product, the Avitech Aeronautical Exchange Layer (AxL) which offers reliable messaging over publish/subscribe and request/reply modes of interaction.

This awareness includes close coordination with sovereign airspace, aircraft and\u00a0 ground resources around the world for proper international harmonisation. Hence, the integration of space vehicles within a global context is key to safe operations, stakeholder situational awareness and maximum value. This contribution leverages existing SWIM and nascent applications to address a use case scenario of a SpacecraftReentryHazardAreaService. This use case will demonstrate where the trajectory runtime data of a hypothetical spacecraft is translated in a reentry hazard area due to potential debris threatening of the air space, aircraft and ground assets."
